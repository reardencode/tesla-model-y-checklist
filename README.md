# Tesla Model Y Delivery Checklist

## Exterior

### Locked

- [ ] Vehicle VIN matches the assigned VIN
- [ ] Color is as ordered

- [ ] Make sure the hood sits flush with the quarter panels and frunk
- [ ] Inspect that the windshield isn't installed shifted (the gaps between the glass and A pillar on either side
should be approximately equal). An improperly installed windshield causes significant wind noise at highway speeds.

- [ ] Inspect all wheel wells. Each wheel well is fitted with noise dampener covers that are attached to the body with a combination of plastic
pins (pushed in all the way) and metal threaded pins (sticking out) with plastic nuts. Confirm that all plastic pins are present
(there are no empty holes) and all metal pins (2 in each front wheel well, 4 in each rear wheel well) are present and properly attached.

[reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModelY/comments/gyhim1/is_this_normal_my_brake_pedal_arm_has_a_welded/) of

## Final thoughts about your delivery inspection

- After leaving the lot you have 72 hours/100 miles to **report delivery issues to be fixed free of charge**. The 72 hours
refers to items subject to "wear and tear," such as paint defects, scratches, etc. Any item that would normally be covered
under warranty is still covered under warranty, but things like blemishes, scratches, dings, scuffs, aren't covered by any
other car company. However check [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModelY/comments/hh8mgv/rattling_in_back_seats_reported_within_7_days/)
about a problem reported within the first 7 days of ownership and being asked to accept a cost estimate.

> Note: the information about refusing delivery and reporting delivery issues has been
> contributed by several people. I couldn't find the authoritative source; pointers appreciated. 

## Ownership beyond the first 1,000 miles

Making it past the above milestones doesn't mean that SC visits or Mobile Service appointments are a thing of the past. Remaining problems caused by
QC issues may be covered by [Tesla's New Vehicle Warranty](https://www.tesla.com/support/vehicle-warranty), which for Long Range and Performance
MYs is 8 years or 120,000 miles. Here are a few things to keep an eye on:

* __Door rubber gaskets__ Keep an eye on the gaskets, particularly on the door bottoms (see above under Unlocked).
* __Tail light condensation__ Wide temperature changes (such as when leaving the vehicle parked in the sun) may cause condensation to appear in the rear tail
lights. Should that happen fairly evenly across all 4 lights Tesla won't do anything about it. You may have better luck if it's asymmetric so keep an eye for that.
* __Trim liner__ Poor quality adhesive, bad adhesive application, or a combination of both could cause trim liner pieces glued to the trim to come off. For example,
here's the [liner peeling off from the lift gate trim](https://imgur.com/a/mqvdf77) after only a couple of months. Keep an eye on glued parts and schedule
service for anything that's coming loose.

Pull requests for changes/additions welcome.
